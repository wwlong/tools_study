This is the most elegant doubly linked list implementation
I have ever seen in C. For those who fret about C not having
a good list data structure, fret no more. The list is stolen
from Linux kernel. I just removed hardware prefetching from
the source code so that we can use it for user-space apps.

For sample code, see the hash table that I implemented using
this list.

Some of this code is written for the security classes I teach. Thus, may be heavily commented; I am not sure if that's a good thing or bad thing.
List -- Very elegant, type oblivious doubly linked list in C from Linux source tree. Also see this and hash table below.
Hashtable -- A type oblivious hash table in C using the list above.
Simple Scheduler -- A simple packet scheduler that allows you to "describe" the type of packets you're interested in and evaluate a set of BPF expressions on the fly and schedule the appropriate packets to appropriate places.
Tcpspoof -- A skeleton for a packet generator that spoofs TCP packets of choice.
Minisniff -- A skeleton for a network sniffer using pcap library.
URLsniff -- A specialized sniffer that uses minisniff to pick up URLs from the wire.
jpeg-stats -- Gives various statistics about jpeg images, can dump various components of images etc. requires jpeg-lib for compilation
